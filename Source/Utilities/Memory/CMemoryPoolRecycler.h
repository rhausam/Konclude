			 *		\brief		A process wide store of released memory pools of the default size, from
			 *					which the pool providers serve their next acquisitions before they allocate.
			 *
			 *					The pools of a task are acquired on the thread that creates the task and
			 *					released on the thread that completes it. Without this store every provider
			 *					hands released pools straight back to the allocator, which keeps them in the
			 *					cache of the releasing thread, while the acquiring thread keeps taking fresh
			 *					memory from the system; a long sequence of tests then grows the process by
			 *					the memory of every pool it ever acquired, most of it idle. The store is
			 *					bounded by a number of pools, and anything beyond that is freed as before.
