			 *		\brief		Decides from the precomputed saturation alone whether a named class is subsumed
			 *					by a query concept, so that the sub class search of the complex expression
			 *					answering handler does not have to create a tableau job for every node it
			 *					visits. The saturation of a named class is complete for the deterministic
			 *					part of the ontology and is what the classifier reads its subsumers from;
			 *					here the structure of the query concept is matched against it. Whenever the
			 *					saturation of a node is marked insufficient, critical or unprocessed, or the
			 *					concept leaves the fragment that can be matched, the verdict is UNDECIDED and
			 *					the caller creates the job as before, so a verdict is never a guess.
