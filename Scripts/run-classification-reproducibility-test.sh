# Classifies an ontology repeatedly with the same binary and fails if the runs do not all
# infer the same class hierarchy.
#
# This is a regression test for a defect in which COptimizedKPSetClassSubsumptionClassifierThread
# took the subsumers of a concept from its precomputed saturation and skipped the subsumption
# tests, losing inferences when the extracted set was incomplete. Which concepts lost subsumers
# depended on the memory layout of the process, so the same binary over the same file produced
# different hierarchies from run to run. That is the signature this test looks for: it needs no
# reference reasoner and no expected output, only that the reasoner agrees with itself.
#
# The comparison is not byte wise. Konclude does not emit a canonical document: which member of
# a set of equivalent classes an edge is hung on varies between runs, and so does the order of
# the elements. Both are meaning preserving. Every class is therefore rewritten to the smallest
# member of its equivalence class and the resulting edges are deduplicated and sorted before the
# runs are compared, which leaves exactly the differences that change what was inferred.
#
# Usage: ./run-classification-reproducibility-test.sh [-n <runs>] [-i <ontology>] [-c <config>] [<Konclude binary>]
#
#   -n <runs>      how often to classify, at least 2, 4 by default
#   -i <ontology>  the ontology to classify, Tests/galen.owl.xml by default
#   -c <config>    a configuration file to classify with, none by default
#
# A larger and more redundant ontology exercises the defect far better than the default one.
# SNOMED CT lost between 3 and 42 subsumptions per run before the fix; Tests/galen.owl.xml is
# small enough that it may well never have lost any, so a clean run of the default is weak
# evidence on its own. It is the default because it is the only ontology in the repository.
#
# What this test cannot do: it compares the runs against each other and not against a reference,
# so it only reports a defect that makes the result vary. One that loses the same inferences on
# every run passes it. The defect it was written for did vary, but it varied intermittently -
# runs that lose nothing are common, and several clean runs in a row mean little. Increase -n
# rather than read a single clean result as evidence, and use an ontology on which the reasoner
# does enough work to be worth testing.
