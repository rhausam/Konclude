/**
 * Asks the native reasoner, corresponds to
 * Source/Control/Interface/JNI/com_konclude_jnibridge_QueryingBridge.cpp.
 *
 * All 19 entry points that the native side declares are declared here: 12 queries about a
 * named entity, the builder and 5 queries for a class expression, and the progress of the
 * calculations.
 *
 * An entity is identified by its IRI, the object beside it is only handed over so that the
 * native side can remember it if the entity has not been built before. The results are not
 * returned, they are reported to the callback listener, which receives the objects that were
 * handed over while the entities were built.
 *
 * The hierarchy queries report a set per set of equivalent entities and therefore take a
 * SetOfObjectSetCallbackListener, the queries that answer with a flat set take an
 * ObjectSetCallbackListener. A reported set can be empty, for instance for the bottom node
 * if no object has been associated with owl:Nothing while the ontology was built.
 *
 *
 * QUERIES ABOUT A CLASS EXPRESSION
 *
 * A class expression that is not a named class, the ObjectSomeValuesFrom of a DL query for
 * instance, is built first, through an AxiomExpressionBuildingBridge that
 * initOWLClassExpressionBuilder binds to this querying bridge. That builder writes into a
 * revision of the installed ontology that is never installed, so the expression does not
 * change the ontology, and the expression stays valid as long as this querying bridge is
 * open. The address it returns is what the class expression queries take, like the arguments
 * of the building bridge. The results are reported like those of the named queries. A query
 * that the native side does not answer throws a KoncludeReasonerException, since an empty
 * answer is a valid one.
 *
 *
 * WHAT THE NATIVE SIDE DOES NOT ANSWER
 *
 * The queries do not cover the OWL API OWLReasoner interface. Missing are the hierarchy
 * of the data properties, the disjoint classes and properties, the domains and the ranges of
 * properties, the inverse properties, the different individuals, the data property values
 * and the entailment check, so the native side has to be extended for them.
