/**
 * An OWL API OWLReasoner on top of the JNI bridge of Konclude.
 *
 * The ontology is translated into the native side once, when the reasoner is created, and
 * again by flush() after the ontology has changed, since the bridge cannot update an
 * installed ontology. The reasoner therefore buffers, see getBufferingMode.
 *
 * The reasoner holds a library instance of Konclude and has to be closed with dispose().
 *
 *
 * WHAT THE BRIDGE CANNOT ANSWER
 *
 * The querying bridge provides 12 queries about a named entity and 5 about a class expression,
 * which do not cover the OWLReasoner interface. The methods that it cannot answer throw an
 * UnsupportedOperationException instead of answering with an empty node set, because an
 * empty node set is a valid answer and a caller cannot tell it from 'not supported'.
 *
 * The native side has no query for these:
 *
 *   getDisjointClasses, getDisjointObjectProperties, getDisjointDataProperties
 *   getInverseObjectProperties
 *   getObjectPropertyDomains, getObjectPropertyRanges, getDataPropertyDomains
 *   getSubDataProperties, getSuperDataProperties, getEquivalentDataProperties
 *   getTopDataPropertyNode, getBottomDataPropertyNode
 *   getDataPropertyValues
 *   getDifferentIndividuals
 *   isEntailed
 *
 * The object property hierarchy and the same individuals used to be unsupported here as well,
 * because four of the 12 queries of the bridge reported nothing. That was a defect of the
 * native side, not of the translation, and it has been fixed, see Java/Readme.md.
 *
 * A query about an anonymous class expression, getSubClasses of an ObjectSomeValuesFrom for
 * instance, is answered as well, for isSatisfiable, the sub, super and equivalent classes and
 * the instances. The expression is built through a second building bridge that the querying
 * bridge binds to a revision of the installed ontology, so that the ontology is not changed,
 * and the native side answers it with the complex answering queries of its OWLlink interface.
 * The first such query pays for the preparation of that machinery. A named class keeps
 * being answered from the class hierarchy directly.
 *
 * Every native call of a reasoner runs on a thread of its own, see guard: CJNIHandler keeps
 * the JNIEnv and the method ids of the thread that initialised the library instance, so all
 * calls of one instance have to happen on that thread, and a caller such as Protege, which
 * classifies on a worker thread and asks from the event thread, must not have to know that.
 * A time out of the configuration is applied to the wait for that thread.
 *
 * An entity that the ontology does not mention is a fresh entity, see FreshEntityPolicy. The
 * native side is never asked about one: with DISALLOW a FreshEntitiesException is thrown, with
 * ALLOW the answer is the trivial one, an empty node set, and this applies to a class
 * expression as soon as one of its entities is fresh.
 *
 * isEntailmentCheckingSupported answers false for every axiom type, which is what the
 * interface asks for when isEntailed is not implemented.
