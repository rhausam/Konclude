# OVERVIEW

Konclude is a tableau-based reasoner for the Description Logic SROIQV(D), i.e.,SROIQ(D) + Nominal Schemas, and covers almost all features of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) 2 DL. Konclude is still under active development and the current version probably contains some bugs and other errors. If you find an unexpected/strange behaviour you are cordially invited to report it. See http://konclude.com/feedback.html for details.

Konclude uses the following libraries:
- Qt 5.11 or above (https://www.qt.io/download), released under LGPLv3 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). Note that Konclude uses slightly modified versions of Qt containers (QMap, QHash, QList, see Source/Utilities/Container/CQtManagedRestrictedModification* files) for an integrated memory management, which were released under LGPLv2.1 and, hence, are available under the GPLv3 in oder to ensure compatiblity with LGPLv3 (cf. https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AllCompatibility).
  
- Redland RDF Libraries (http://librdf.org/), released under the LGPL 2.1 (or newer), GPL 2, and Apache 2 licenses. Note that the Redland RDF Libraries are optional and only required if RDF triples have to be parsed and mapped to OWL axioms or if more complex SPARQL queries have to be answered. For the latter, it is recommended to use the forked version of the Redland Rasqal query library on Konclude's Github page (https://github.com/konclude/rasqal) since it contains a few fixes and performance improvements.


# USAGE

The binaries of Konclude (and possibly some shared libraries) are located in the `Binaries` directory. However, you can use the starter scripts in the main directory for directly invoking Konclude with `Konclude` (Windows) or `./Konclude` (Linux, Mac). The command line parameter '-h' shows the usage options for Konclude. Some examples are located in the `Tests` directory. See http://konclude.com/ for detailed usage instructions.

- COMMAND LINE:

	Basic reasoning tasks such as classification, consistency, class satisfiability, and realisation can be directly invoked with the command line interface. For this, Konclude has to be called with the corresponding command (`classification`, `consistency`, `satisfiability`, or `realisation`) and at least the input file has to be specified with `-i FILEPATH`. The output file is optional and can be set with the `-o FILEPATH` argument. The	class satisfiability checking additionally requires the IRI of the class that has to be tested, which has to be specified with `-x IRI`.
	
	Please note that Konclude natively only supports ontologies in the OWL 2 XML [1] or in the OWL 2 Functional Style format [2]. The optional integration of the Redland RDF Libraries allow for parsing RDF serialization formats, but the mapping to OWL constructs must be considered as experimental. Hence, you may use the protege editor [3] to convert ontologies in other syntaxes into a fully supported format.

	Examples (omit ./ on Windows):
    ```	
    ./Konclude classification -i Tests/roberts-family-full-D.owl.xml -o roberts-family-full-class-hierarchy.owl.xml
	./Konclude satisfiability -i Tests/roberts-family-full-D.owl.xml -x http://www.co-ode.org/roberts/family-tree.owl#Aunt
    ```	


- OWLLINK:

	Furthermore, Konclude processes OWLlink [4] requests with the XML binding [5]. 
	Konclude is optimised to read/write the OWLlink requests/responses from/to files. 
	For this, Konclude has to be called with the `owllinkfile` command and at least 
	with the parameter `-i FILEPATH`, where FILEPATH specifies the OWLlink request/query 
	file. The OWLlink response file can be specified with the `-o FILEPATH` parameter.

	Examples (omit ./ on Windows):

    ```	
    ./Konclude owllinkfile -i Tests/galen-classify-request.xml -o response.xml
    ./Konclude owllinkfile -i Tests/roberts-family-full-D-classify-realize-request.xml
	./Konclude owllinkfile -c Configs/default-config.xml -i Tests/1b-satisfiability-request.xml
    ```	


	Currently, Konclude supports only the following subset of OWLlink commands:
	- GetDescription, CreateKB, GetSettings, Set, ReleaseKB, Tell, 
	  LoadOntologies (IRIs must be files), Classify, Realize
	- GetAllObjectProperties, GetAllIndividuals, GetAllClasses, GetKBLanguage
	- IsClassSatisfiable, GetSubClassHierarchy, GetSubClasses (only for atomic concepts), 
	  GetSuperClasses (only for atomic concepts), GetEquivalentClasses (only for atomic concepts)
	- GetTypes, GetFlattenedTypes, GetInstances (only for atomic concepts), 
	  GetFlattenedInstances (only for atomic concepts)

	Furthermore, all OWL 2 ontologies/axioms used in LoadOntologies/Tell 
	commands should be in the OWL 2 XML [1] or in the OWL 2 Functional Style [2] 
	format and Konclude does currently NOT process any annotations. The protege 
	editor [2] can be used to convert OWL 2 ontologies between different 
	formats.
	

	Konclude can also be used as an OWLlink server that answers OWLlink requests
	sent over HTTP. For this, Konclude has to be called with the 'owllinkserver'
	command. The listening port can optionally be specified by the parameter `-p`, 
	otherwise the default port 8080 is used.

	Examples (omit ./ on Windows):

    ```
    ./Konclude owllinkserver -p 8080
    ```	
	

	Large ontologies should separately be loaded with the LoadOntologies 
	OWLlink command, because the request files are completely loaded 
	into the main memory of the system. In contrast, the files referenced by
	the LoadOntologies commands are parsed in a stream-based manner.


- SPARQL:

    A trivial SPARQL HTTP server is integrated that supports processing of some basic SPARQL Update commands and answering of some ABox related queries. Note that Konclude by itself can only process queries with simple Basic Graph Patterns, where variables are used for individuals. More complex SPARQL queries (e.g., with UNION, OPTIONAL, FILTER, MINUS, etc.) are supported via the Redland RASQAL integration, which is however not fully optimized. Note that the SPARQL requests/queries must be encoded as HTTP POST requests. Alternatively the SPARQL requests can also directly be loaded from files with the `sparqlfile` command. Note that the last loaded ontology is interpreted as the default graph, i.e., it is automatically used if no graph/knowledge base is specified in the query.

    Examples (omit ./ on Windows):

    ```
    ./Konclude sparqlserver -p 8080 -c Configs/querying-config.xml
    ./Konclude sparqlfile -s Tests/lubm-univ-bench-sparql-load-and-query-test.sparql -o Tests/query-answers.xml -c Configs/querying-config.xml
    ./Konclude sparqlfile -s Tests/roberts-family-full-sparql-existential-variables-query-test.sparql -i Tests/roberts-family-full-D.owl.xml
    ```

    Currently, the following SPARQL commands/queries are (partially) supported:
    - LOAD, SELECT, ASK

    Note that the settings of the `Configs/querying-config.xml` file are automatically enabled if the `sparqlserver` or `sparqlfile` commands are used in order to deactivate some optimizations that are not yet compatible with the integrated query answering engine. However, the `Configs/querying-config.xml` file also contains some commented out settings that may be interesting for configuring some query answering aspects in more detail (e.g., concurrency, interpretation of anonymous variables, etc.).


- JNI:

	Konclude further contains a very basic and experimental JNI bridge in `Source/Control/Interface/JNI`, which is compiled into a shared library by `KoncludeLIB.pro` and which allows for building axioms and for asking a part of the supported questions directly from Java, i.e., without the OWLlink interface. The `Java` directory contains the Java classes that the bridge requires, a smoke test of the bridge, a translator from the OWL API into it and an implementation of the OWL API `OWLReasoner` interface on top of it, see `Java/Readme.md`. Note that only a part of the reasoning questions is provided by the bridge, so the reasoner reports the questions that it cannot answer as unsupported, and that the wrapper has not been used in a Protege plug-in yet. Several defects of the bridge itself, which had never been driven from Java before, were found and fixed along the way, see `Java/Readme.md`.


- CONFIGURATION:

	Konclude can be configured with configuration files, which are also OWLlink request files where only the 'Set' command is used. 'Set' commands without the specification of a specific knowledge base configure the default settings in Konclude, which are used to instantiate the configurations of newly created knowledge bases. It is highly recommended to NOT change the default configuration of Konclude, because many available configurations are only for debugging, testing and experimenting. However, if Konclude requires too much main memory, then you can try to deactivate the satisfiability or unsatisfiability caching (see example configuration file in `Configs` directory). The parameter `-c FILEPATH` can be used to load a configuration file.


- KNOWN ISSUES:

	Incomplete realisation for qualified minimum cardinality restrictions:
	the instance retrieval can lose instances of classes that are defined by a qualified minimum cardinality restriction, i.e., `Realize`, `GetInstances` and `GetFlattenedInstances` then report only a part of the instances of such a class. The entailment check is not affected, so `IsInstanceOf` still answers correctly for the very same individuals, and the classification of the class hierarchy is also unaffected.

	A minimal example is `Tests/min-cardinality-realization.owl.xml` with the corresponding OWLlink request `Tests/min-cardinality-realization-request.xml`, where `IsInstanceOf` answers true for the individual `p` while `GetFlattenedInstances` returns an empty set. For `Tests/roberts-family-full-D.owl.xml`, only 1 of the 60 instances of `PersonWithManySibling` is reported, whereas the instances of `ParentOfLargeFamily` are reported completely even though that class is defined by a minimum cardinality restriction as well. Which instances are lost therefore depends on the ontology, and for some ontologies it also varies between runs, which is why the number of processing units configured with `-w` can appear to influence the result.

	Deactivating the upfront merging of possible instance concepts, an optimization of the realisation, avoids the problem in all observed cases:

	```
	./Konclude realization -c Configs/no-upfront-instance-merging-config.xml -i Tests/roberts-family-full-D.owl.xml -o roberts-family-full-realization.owl.xml
	```

	makes the realisation complete and reproducible, all 60 instances are then reported, but also somewhat slower, about 30 percent for the example above. So far the problem has only been observed for classes that are defined by a qualified minimum cardinality restriction.


	High memory consumption for large ontologies:
	classifying a large ontology needs a multiple of the memory of the ontology itself, and the memory is not released before the process ends. Classifying SNOMED CT (320k classes, 750k axioms, 297 MB in OWL 2 XML) reaches about 14 GB, which makes it unsuitable for a machine with little free memory, in particular when it is classified from an application such as Protege that holds the ontology as well.

	The memory is allocated while the ontology is precomputed, i.e., during the saturation of the concepts, and not while it is parsed: for the example above, the memory grows to 1.9 GB until the preprocessing is finished and then to 15.6 GB during the precomputation, while the classification itself stays below that. It does not depend noticeably on the number of processing units configured with `-w` (13.8 GB for `-w 1`, 15.7 GB for `-w 4`, 13.7 GB for `-w AUTO` on 16 cores), nor on how the ontology reaches the reasoner: loading it from a file with `LoadOntologies` instead of sending it with an OWLlink `Tell` request changes the peak only from 33 GB to 32 GB.

	The optimizations that build the saturation data cannot be traded for memory with the available settings. Deactivating `Konclude.Calculation.Optimization.SaturationCaching` or `Konclude.Calculation.Optimization.SaturationExpansionSatisfiabilityCacheWriting` increases the memory instead (15.6 GB and 15.4 GB for the example above), and activating the calculation memory limit with `Konclude.Calculation.Memory.AllocationLimitation` did not finish the precomputation within 15 minutes. Deactivating `Konclude.Calculation.Optimization.ConceptSaturation` does reduce the memory to 2.4 GB, but it does not classify the ontology any more: the result then contains every class as a direct subclass of `owl:Thing`.

	For a knowledge base that is served over OWLlink, note that releasing it with `ReleaseKB`, which is what Protege does when the reasoner is stopped, frees the knowledge base but does not return the memory to the system. A subsequent classification reuses it, so the server does not grow further, but the memory becomes available to other processes only when the server is restarted.



# REQUIREMENTS, INSTALLATION, BUILD

On GitHub, there is an up-to-date Docker image of Konclude available (`docker pull konclude/konclude`, cf. https://hub.docker.com/r/konclude/konclude), which should run on most platforms with Docker installed.

In principle, Konclude requires Qt 5.11 libraries or above [6], but they are included (or statically integrated/linked into the binary) for the released versions for most platfroms. If this is not the case, then you should install them manually on your system.

On Mac, you may be required to deactivate the 'Unidentified Developer' warning dialogue for Konclude (cf. [10]).

On Windows-based platforms, it may further be necessary to install the .Net Framework [7] and the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package [8] for executing Konclude.


Konclude can be built by running qmake (which is part of the Qt Framework) for `Konclude.pro` or `KoncludeWithoutRedland.pro`, e.g., 
```
qmake -o Makefile Konclude.pro
```
and then by compiling the sources with the generated makefile, i.e., the command
```
make
```
has to be executed/called. Note that you may have to adapt the paths to the Redland libraries in the `Konclude.pro` file. If you have docker installed, then you may simply use the provided Dockerfiles [9] for building Konclude (which download/install all dependent libraries, compile Konclude and create a statically linked binary). For this, go into the KoncludeDocker' directory and run the following command:
```
./build_release.sh
```
For more details for building with docker, see also `KoncludeDocker/README.md`.

Setting up Konclude for building/compiling with Visual Studio 2015/2017:
- Make sure that Qt is installed and the environment variable QTDIR is set to the QT directory
- Install the QT VS Tools/Package extension for Visual Studio (enables more comfortable debugging)
- Copy the QT DLLs (Qt5Networkd.dll, Qt5Network.dll, Qt5Xmld.dll, Qt5Xml.dll, Qt5Cored.dll, Qt5Core.dll, Qt5Concurrentd.dll, Qt5Concurrent.dll) into the root directory of Konclude
